# ysa-map-tool
A web application that allows you to save marker locations in a JSON file.


# Installation

- Go to the directory of the app in terminal.
- Run 'npm install'

To start the server:
- Run 'npm start'

# Usage

- Click on the map to place a marker that you want to save.
- Fill in the form that is shown to save latitude and longitude with a name and pass color.
- Click Save (Saving this form just adds it to an array of objects)
- Click Export when finished saving the markers you wish to keep
- Click Download to download the JSON file. (Or just look in your root directory (client side application))
After you have saved all of the markers you want to keep. Click Export.
Export will show you the string that is going to be saved to a file.
Clicking download will then download this json file. (Which as I'm typing this just realized how pointless that was to implement
considering this is a client side application.)
